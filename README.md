# SEG2106_L3
This is the java code for the SEG2106 L3 report, to be handed in February 23rd 2015. At the moment, the Main class needs a Delivery object to be created, and sent into the CoffeMachine's constructor to be initialized. Afterwards, threads can be created in the user class and used as use cases, to get the required output. 

Godspeed. Everyone's counting on you.
